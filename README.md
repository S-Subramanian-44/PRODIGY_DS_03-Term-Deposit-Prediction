## Task 3: Building a Decision Tree Classifier

### Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project conducted during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The main objective of this project was to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data, using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Key Objectives

- **Data Preparation:** Utilized the Bank Marketing dataset to source relevant demographic and behavioral data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Model Building:** Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting customer purchases.
- **Model Evaluation:** Ensured robustness through testing and validation processes.

### Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
